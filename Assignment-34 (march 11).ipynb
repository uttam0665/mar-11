    "To calculate a confidence interval, the following steps are typically followed:\n",

    "3.Compute the sample statistic: Calculate the sample statistic that represents the parameter of interest. For example, if estimating a population mean, the sample mean is computed.\n",

    "It is calculated based on the standard error of the sample statistic and depends on the desired confidence level.\n",

    "    With a sample size of 100 and a 95% confidence level, the margin of error can be determined from the t-table or using statistical software, resulting in, for example, a margin of error of 1.98 cm.\n",
